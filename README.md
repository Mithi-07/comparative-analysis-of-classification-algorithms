## Comparative-Analysis-of-Classification-Algorithms

In this project, we investigate the application of machine learning algorithms to predict diabetes outcomes based on clinical features.
The dataset used in this study encompasses various clinical parameters, including Glucose levels, Body Mass Index (BMI), Age, Pregnancies, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Insulin levels, Skin Thickness, and Blood Pressure. These features are essential indicators of diabetes risk and are commonly utilized in clinical assessments.
Machine learning techniques offer a promising approach to diabetes prediction, utilizing patterns inherent in large datasets to develop predictive models. Specifically, we explore three classification algorithms: Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), and Logistic Regression.
Naïve Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem, making it suitable for classification tasks with both categorical and continuous features. K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) is a non-parametric method that classifies new instances based on the majority class among its k nearest neighbors in the feature space. Logistic Regression, a linear model for binary classification, estimates the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class.

# Procedure
1. Dataset Acquisition and Preprocessing: 
The dataset 'diabetes.csv' was obtained and loaded into the analysis environment using the Pandas library in Python. Preprocessing steps were conducted to handle missing values, if any, and standardize numerical features to ensure data integrity and quality.
2. Correlation Analysis: 
Correlation coefficients between each feature and the target variable (Outcome) were computed using the Pandas library. The correlation coefficients provided insights into the relative importance of each feature in predicting diabetes outcomes.
3. Feature Selection: 
Features were selected based on their correlation coefficients with the target variable and domain knowledge regarding their relevance to diabetes prediction. Multiple feature combinations were considered for analysis, including:
- Glucose and BMI
- Glucose, BMI, and Age
- Glucose, BMI, Age, and Pregnancies
4. Classification Algorithms: 
Three classification algorithms were implemented for diabetes outcome prediction:
- Naïve Bayes Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Classifier
- Logistic Regression Classifier
These classifiers were trained and tested using the scikit-learn library in Python. Each classifier's accuracy was calculated to evaluate its performance in predicting diabetes outcomes.
5. Model Evaluation: 
Confusion matrices were generated for each classifier to visualize their classification performance, including true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions. Decision boundaries were plotted for K-NN and Logistic Regression classifiers to illustrate the separation of classes in the feature space. Additionally, the logistic regression line, representing the decision boundary, was derived, and visualized to depict the relationship between Glucose and BMI features.
6. Statistical Analysis: 
Statistical tests, such as ANOVA or t-tests, were applied where applicable to determine the significance of observed differences in classifier performance or feature importance.
7. Visualization: 
Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries were utilized to create visualizations, including confusion matrices, decision boundaries, and logistic regression lines, aiding in the interpretation of results.
8. Software and Libraries: 
Python programming language was used for implementation. Libraries utilized include pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, and mlxtend.
